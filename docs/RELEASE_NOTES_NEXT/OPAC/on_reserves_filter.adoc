= Course Reserve Search Filter =

This filter allows users to limit their search to records that are
    attached to courses at particular libraries, like so:
    
        biology on_reserve(5, 10)
    
The filter can also be negated to search for records that are not
attached to a course:
    
        biology -on_reserve(5)

If an organization is opted into the Course Materials module, this
filter will appear on the search results page of the public catalog.
Staff at these organizations will have a new option in their
staff catalog search preferences to enable this filter in the staff
catalog as well.
