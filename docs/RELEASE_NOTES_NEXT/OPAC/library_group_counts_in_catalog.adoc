### Library Group Item Counts in catalog

When a user selects a library group in the catalog (either the
public catalog or the staff catalog), the catalog now displays
the number of items held and available in that group.  This
information supplements the existing holding statements
available in the catalog.

If you have customized any of the following files, you will need
to update them to see the library group item counts.

* opac/parts/misc_util.tt2
* opac/parts/record/copy_counts.tt2
* opac/parts/result/copy_counts.tt2
