== Improve OPAC URI link purpose display and coverage ==

Previously, the logic used in the OPAC and staff client to display
non-located URIs was slightly different. In particular, the staff client
included any 856 with an ind2 value of 0, 1, or 2, and provided a label
indicating the purpose of the URI based on the ind2 value. The OPAC, on
the other hand, only displayed 856s with an ind2 of 0 or 1, and did
not distinguish the purpose.

Now the OPAC displays non-located URIs in the same ways as the staff
client, including those with an ind2 value of 2 and displaying a
descriptive purpose with the link.
