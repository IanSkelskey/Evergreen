== Creating carousels from item bucket or item status ==

The item status interfaces has a new option:
"Create Carousel from Selected Items".  The item bucket
interface has a new option: "Create Carousel from Bucket".
Both of these options allow users to create carousels, which
can later be edited as needed in the Carousels Admin interface.

One use case for the new item bucket interface is to allow
libraries to showcase existing item buckets that they have
created for a holiday, program, or display.
