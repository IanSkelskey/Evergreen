New Setting for Default URI Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a URI does not have a 856$z defining a note to display next to
it in the OPAC you can use the opac.uri_default_note_text setting
to define one.

This feature helps to save catalogers time.  If your library has
a note that should be added to a wide range of electronic resources,
rather than applying the note to all applicable records, you can set
this setting to an appropriate value, and add an 856$z note for any
resources that shouldn't receive the default note.
