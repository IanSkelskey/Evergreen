== Google Analytics 4 Update ==

Google is transitioning from Universal Analytics
to GA4 during the Summer of 2023, which requires
an update to the Javascript that is embedded in the 
public catalog pages. 

Note that Google requires each site to set up a
new unique code (G-) that replaces the old
(UA-) code and this will also need to be updated in
config.tt2.
