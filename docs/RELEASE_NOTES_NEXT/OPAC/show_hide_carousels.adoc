== OPAC setting to show/hide carousels ==

There is a new setting to hide carousels from the public catalog.  This can be useful in cases
where carousels are created for use in other sites (e.g. on library websites), rather than
for use in the public catalog.

You can turn off carousels in config.tt2 by setting `ctx.show_carousels` to `'false'`.
