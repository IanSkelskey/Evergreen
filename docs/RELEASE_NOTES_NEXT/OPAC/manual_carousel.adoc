== Editing manual carousels via the original bucket ==

Creating a carousel from a bucket no longer creates a new "System-created bucket".  When
a new carousel is generated from a record bucket, any changes made to the bucket will be
automatically reflected in the carousel. Staff no longer need to go to the Carousels
Administration screen to make these changes.

This change only affects newly created carousels.  Existing manual carousels will still
need to be edited via the Carousels Administration screen.
