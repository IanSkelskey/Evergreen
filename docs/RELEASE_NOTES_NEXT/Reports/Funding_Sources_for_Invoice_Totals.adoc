== Reporting Sources for Invoice Totals ==

Three new reporting sources are available to permit reporting
on the total amount of invoices, including both line items and
direct charges. The sources are:

  * Invoice Totals
  * Invoice Debits by Fund
  * Invoice Debits by Fund Tag

These sources are meant to be used as the base source of a report,
with any additional fields and tables of interest brought via
navigating links in the template editor.
