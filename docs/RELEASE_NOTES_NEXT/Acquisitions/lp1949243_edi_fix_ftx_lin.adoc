== EDI Attribute Added for Enumerating Lineitems Sequentially ==

Historically, Evergreen's EDI output has used the internal lineitem ID as the
line sequence number in LIN lines.  Some vendors (e.g. ULS) would prefer LIN to
use a sequentially assigned number instead.  A new EDI attribute, "Lineitems
Are Enumerated Sequentially," has been added to support that.  See
[LP 1949243](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1949243) for further
discussion.
