== Lineitem Detail Audit Table ==

The default schema has added an audit table for the
`acq.lineitem_detail` table.  The audit table is NOT created during
database upgrade.  If you wish to add the audit table to your
Evergreen installation, you can run the following SQL in your
database:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT acq.create_acq_auditor ( 'acq', 'lineitem_detail' );
CREATE INDEX acq_lineitem_detail_hist_id_idx ON acq.acq_lineitem_detail_history( id );
CREATE INDEX acq_lineitem_detail_hist_lineitem_idx ON acq.acq_lineitem_detail_history( lineitem );
CREATE INDEX acq_lineitem_detail_hist_fund_debit_idx ON acq.acq_lineitem_detail_history( fund_debit );
