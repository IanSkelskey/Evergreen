This work represents the last major part of the multi-year Angular Acquisitions
project. The Invoices and Claims interfaces have been reimplemented in Angular
and have had several improvements, including scoping claim policy actions;
adding a summary to invoices recording funds and charges; integration with
Acquisitions Search; and other bugfixes.

The MARC Federated search and Z39.50 search interfaces have also been
reimplemented in Angular, including several bugfixes associated with Z39.50
search in particular.

A new component is also added for the MARC Batch Import/Export (Vandelay) and
Load MARC Order Records interfaces that allows for background processing of
record imports. There is a checkbox in each of these interfaces labeled
_Request background import_ and a field to enter an email address. If a user
selects background import, they can navigate away from the import screen while
the import continues processing in the background. If they enter an email
address, they will recieve a notification when the import is complete. Status
and history of background imports for each user can be seen in the MARC Batch
Import/Export interface under the new _Background Imports_ tab.
