== Dark Mode ==

The staff client now supports both light and dark modes.  By default, the staff client will
use the color mode setting from your operating system.  That is to say, if you have turned on
Dark Mode for your operating system, or if your operating system defaults to Dark Mode, the
Evergreen staff client will now also display in Dark Mode. 

If you'd like to use a different color mode in the staff client than your operating system
setting, you can do so using the color mode selector in the navigation bar at the top of the
staff client.  If you want to resume using your operating system's color mode, you can set
the color mode selector to "Auto".
