== Improve Button Colors in Staff Client ==

Yellow is no longer used as a button color in the staff client
for normal actions such as closing dialogs that do not involve
a condition that actually requrires a warning.

Instead, light grey is used as a default color for buttons
that do secondary actions, with a variant that includes red
upon hover or activation for actions that remove data or clear
form input.

=== Developer Notes ===

The `btn-warning` CSS class should be avoided in the staff interface
unless needed for actions that truly require a warning. Instead,
`btn-normal` should be used for secondary actions such as closing
a dialog and `btn-destroy` for actions that would remove or clear
data.
