== Table Density Setting ==

Evergreen staff users can now set their preferred density for
grids throughout the client.  The three options are: compact
(not much whitespace), Standard, and Wide (more whitespace).

To select a setting:

. Go to Administration -> Workstation.
. Select a value from the "Table Density" dropdown.
. Log out of the staff client and log back in to load the newly
  selected density setting.
