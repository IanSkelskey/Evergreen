 * Angularized the Local Administration -> Circulation Policies interface.
 * Added an option to fmEditor for allowing one to unset a field (aka set to null)
 * Added some misc fmEditor tweaks/additions for developers
 * Replaced checkboxes for boolean fields in fmEditor with radio buttons
 * Changed instances of Copy Location to Shelving Location in the IDL, which wil be reflected in many interfaces.
 * Also, in the IDL, every instance of Copy, Copies, and copies in a label become Item, Items, and items, respectively. Except for Copy Location, which is normalized to Shelving Location. And any instance of "Lib" in label gets expanded to "Library".
 * Org Unit becomes Checkout Library for the circ matrix. Checkout is more prevalent in the code than Check Out, but we should pick one.
