 * LP1902120 Customizing the label for items with no parts (formerly "All Parts" or "Any Part")

    This feature creates a new table for localizable strings intended to be used in
    UI's. This is not a replacement for the existing I18N system for templates, but
    does allow developers to choose some strings to be more easily accessible to
    staff/admins for dynamic localization. The string we're focused on here is a
    replacement for the "All Parts" and "Any Part" label in various Place Hold
    interfaces when monographic parts are an option.

    There is a UI for managing such strings under *Administration -> Server
    Administration -> I18N: Localized UI Strings*. An admin could change the
    "string" field directly, or use the existing Apply Translation mechanism to
    customize the string for a specific locale.

    As a bonus feature, we also expose an alternate UI for handling entries for
    said Translation mechanism. This can be found under *Administration -> Server
    Administration -> I18N: Localized Fieldmapper Strings*.

    These customizations are global to the Evergreen installation.
