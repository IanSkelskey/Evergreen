== Adjust Hold Cancel Reasons ==

The dialog to confirm canceling a hold in the staff interface
now lists only hold cancel reasons that can be manually applied,
excluding the ones that can only be automatically applied.

In addition, two more hold cancel reasons are added:

 * Patron via email
 * Patron via SMS
