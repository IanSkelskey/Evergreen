== Expansion of Copy Statuses Eligible to Fill Holds ==

Copies with a status that has both the `holdable` and `is_available`
fields set to `true` are now elibible to fill holds.  This was
previously limited to copies with a "magical" status of 0 or 7.  The
change expands the copies that can fill holds and affords better
control over what copies with what statuses will appear on the holds
pull list or target holds.
