== Add filters to Holds Pull List ==

Two new filter comboboxes have been added to the Holds Pull List, one to filter by Pickup Library
and one to filter by Shelving Locations / Shelving Location Groups. The Print Full List and
Download CSV actions respect the new filters, which will improve usability for libraries with
large pull lists who need to split the list into sections for multiple staff to work on. The
settings are also sticky, which will make it easier for individuals who always work on pulling
holds in the same section of the library every day.
