== Optional Evergreen "Authoritative" API Support ==

Previous versions of Evergreen supported "authoritative" API calls by default.
These are API calls which force database reads to go the primary database
instead of a pooled replica.

Going forward, this functionality will be disabled by default, but may be
enabled via a new opensrf.xml setting.

If your site uses database pooling, with Evergreen actively reading from
replicas, add this setting to your opensrf.xml file within the <default/>
block:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<opensrf version='0.0.3'>
  <default>
    <uses_pooled_read_replica_dbs>true</uses_pooled_read_replica_dbs>
<!-- ... -->
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
