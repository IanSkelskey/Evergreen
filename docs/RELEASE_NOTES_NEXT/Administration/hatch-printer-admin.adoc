== Hatch Print Config Angular Port ==
The Hatch printer settings interface has been ported to Angular.

The checkbox to enable Hatch printing has also been moved from the 
separate (now-retired) "Print Service (Hatch)" interface into the newly 
Angularized "Hatch (Print Service) Printer Settings" interface.
