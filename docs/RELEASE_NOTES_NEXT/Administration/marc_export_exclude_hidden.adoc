== --exclude-hidden option for marc_export ==

The `--exclude-hidden` option, when used in conjunction with
`--items`, will not emit 852 fields for items if they are hidden
from in the OPAC in any of the four ways that this can be
specified in Evergreen. If a bib therefore ends up with no
visible items, it will be excluded from the output.

--------
 --exclude-hidden   Exclude records and items if the item is not
                    OPAC-visible per its org unit, status, shelving,
                    location, or flag on the item record. This option
                    is effective only if the --library and/or --items
                    flags are supplied. This option takes precedence;
                    for example, if the org unit specified by --library
                    is not OPAC-visible, its records will not be included
                    in the export.
