== --pipe option for marc_export ==

Add a --pipe option to marc_export to force reading of record ids from
standard input when one or more of the --library, or
--descendants options are used.  This permits more flexibility when
exporting records with holdings for given libraries or subsets of a
collection.

It is an error to specify the --all or --since  and --pipe options in the same
command line.
