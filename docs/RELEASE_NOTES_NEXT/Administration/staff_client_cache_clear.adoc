== Global Long-Lived Cache Clearing for Staff Client ==

A new global flag (staff.client_cache_key) has been added that allows
administrators to clear certain long-lived cache values from all staff clients
at next login by simply changing the value. Currently only the MARC Tag Tables
used by the bibliographic and authority record editors are cleared, but the
list of localStorage items cleared may be expanded in future. This key is
simply an opaque string - no special format is required - changing the value in
any way will trigger a wave of cache clearing.
