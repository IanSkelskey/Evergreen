== Reporter Lock File Improvements ==

Changes in the location, name, and handling of the reporter's
(`clark-kent.pl`) lockfile may require adjustments in local management
scripts.

The lockfile's default location has been moved from
`/tmp/reporter-LOCK` to `LOCALSTATEDIR/run/reporter.pid`,
`/openils/var/run/reporter.pid` in a default configuration.  This
change allows it to fit in better with other Evergeen utilities that
use a similar location and name for their runtime files: SIPServer,
the MARC stream importer, etc.

If run as a daemon, the reporter now deletes the lockfile when the
main process exits.  This is not only good disk hygiene; the user or
administrator no longer has to manually delete the lockfile before
starting a new instance of the reporter.

Sites with scripts to start and stop the reporter may wish to review
them to determine if this update requires any changes to their
processes.
