== Improvements to Mapping Permissions to Groups ==

The dialog to add permission mappings to a group in the Permission
Groups administrative interface now allows multiple permissions
to be added in one invocation. This reduces the number of clicks
and keyboard interactions required when adding a large number of
permission mappings.
