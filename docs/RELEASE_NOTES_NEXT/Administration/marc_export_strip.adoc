== --strip option for marc_export ==

The --strip option is used to suppress generation of specified elements
from the marc_export output. The option, which can be specified more than
once, is in one if these forms:

[source]
--------
        --strip <field RE>/<subfield RE>
        --strip /<subfield RE>
        --strip <field RE>

Some examples:

        --strip 856/0   [Delete subfield 0's in fields with tag 856.]

Regular expressions are accepted:

        --strip 8../0   [Delete subfield 0's in fields with tag 800-899.]

If the field is omitted, it is as if you specified "..." for the field RE.

    --strip /0      [Delete subfield 0's in all fields.]
    --strip /[abc]  [Delete subfield a, b or c in all fields.]

If the slash and subfield are omitted, it means to delete the given fields.

    -strip 856     [Delete fields with tag 856]

If the slash is present, but the subfield is omitted, it means "all subfields"

    --strip 856/    [Delete all subfields with tag 856]
