== Support Script: marc_export default encoding changed to UTF-8 ==

The default file encoding output when using the *marc_export* script is
now *UTF-8* instead of *MARC8*.  After upgrading check your use of the
*marc_export* script to ensure that if you need an encoding other than 
*UTF-8* you specify it with the argument *--encoding*.  This change has
the possiblity of breaking your workflow.
