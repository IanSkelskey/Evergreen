Apache Proxy LogFormat Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Two `LogFormat` entries have been added to the sample Apache
configuration in `eg.conf.in` that are useful when a proxy runs in
front of Evergreen's Apache.  These configurations mimic the default
"common" and "combined" log formats, but log the remote client's
actual IP address when `mod_remoteip` is enabled.  The entries are
repeated here in case you prefer to manually update your Apache
configuration.

 LogFormat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" proxy-common
 Logformat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" proxy-combined

To use these formats, simply replace the "common" or "combined" at the
end of the `CustomLog` entries in the `eg.conf` file with either the
"proxy-common" or "proxy-combined" entry, depending upon which you
want to use.

From:

 CustomLog "|/usr/bin/logger -p local7.info" common

to:

 CustomLog "|/usr/bin/logger -p local7.info" proxy-common

for example.
