== --852 option for marc_export ==

The new `--852b` switch (when used in conjunction with `--items`)
takes the following values:

 * circ_lib - emit the item circulation library in 852$b
 * owning_lib - emit the owning library in 852$b
 * both - emit owning lib and circ lib as separate repeats
   of $b. This is both the default and legacy behavior.

 --852b             Accepts 'owning_lib', 'circ_lib', or 'both' to
                    control whether the 852 in exported embedded
                    holdings has the owning library, the circulation
                    library, or both in separate repeats of the .
                    If not supplied, defaults to 'both', which is the
                    legacy behavior.
