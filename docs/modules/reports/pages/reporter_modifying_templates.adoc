== Introduction ==

Report templates can be modified to change how the output displays or what data is gathered for the output.

It is recommended that staff run a report from the original template to see what output is generated before modifying a template.

. Start by cloning the template you wish to modify. Follow steps 1 through 7 in xref:reports:reporter_cloning_shared_templates[Cloning a Report Template].
. The _Report Template Editor_ will open. See xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#report_template_editor[Report Template Editor] for information on using the editor.
. Make your desired changes.
. Select *Save Template*.
. Your new template can now be found in the folder you saved it in.
. xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#running_reports[Run a report] from the new template to see if the desired output is generated.

[TIP]
=====
If the path for one of your display fields or filters is incorrect, you will get an error instead of the expected report output. Sometimes the error text will give you a clue about what isn't working.

You can modify your template and try again. It may be helpful to review xref:reports:reporter_create_templates.adoc#troubleshooting_report_templates[Troubleshooring Report Templates].

. Repeat the above steps until your template works as desired.


[NOTE]
======
It is not unusual to create multiple versions of a template when working to modify a template. Once you have a template that works as desired, it is recommended that you delete the interim versions of the template. See xref:reports:reporter_basics.adoc#deleting_report_templates[Deleting Report Templates].
