indexterm:[reports, cloning]

In Evergreen, reports are run from templates that can be used multiple times. Library staff can create their own templates or clone templates from other users, or clone their own templates to make changes or modifications to the template.

When creating a new template it is a good idea to review the shared templates first: even if the exact template you need does not exist it is often faster to modify an existing template than to build a brand new one. A Local System Administrator account is required to clone templates from the Shared Folders section and save them to My Folders.

The steps below assume you have already created at least one folder in _Templates_. If you have not done so, please see xref:reports:reporter_folder.adoc#creating_folders[Creating Folders].

. Navigate to *Administration -> Reports*.
. In the _Shared Folders_ section select the arrow beside the _Templates_ folder to see the shared template folders. Use the arrows to expand the folder tree until you find the folder containing
the template you would like to clone.

. Select the folder name to display the contents.

. From the drop-down menu choose _Clone selected template_. Select *Submit*.

[TIP]
=====
By default Evergreen only displays the first 10 items in any folder. To view all content, change the _Limit output to_ setting from _10_ to _All_. Be aware that this may cause performance issues in large-data systems.

. Select the name of your folder where you'd like to save the cloned template and then click _Select Folder_.

. The template editor will open. For information on modifying templates, see the section on xref:reporter_modifying_templates.adoc[Modifying Templates].
. Update the template name and/or template description if desired.
. Select *Save Template*. Once a template is saved it is not possible to edit the template. To make changes, clone a template and change the clone.

. A pop-up will appear confirming that you wish to save the template. Select *OK/Continue*.
. The template can now be found in the folder you saved it in.
