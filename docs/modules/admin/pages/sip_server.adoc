== About the SIP Protocol ==

indexterm:[Automated Circulation System]
indexterm:[SelfCheck]
indexterm:[Automated Material Handling]

+SIP+, standing for +Standard Interchange Protocol+, was developed by the +3M corporation+ to be a common 
protocol for data transfer between ILS' (referred to in +SIP+ as an _ACS_, or _Automated Circulation System_)  and a 
third party device. Originally, the protocol was developed for use with _3M SelfCheck_ (often abbreviated SC, not to 
be confused with Staff Client) systems, but has since expanded to other companies and devices. It is now common 
to find +SIP+ in use in several other vendors' SelfCheck systems, as well as other non-SelfCheck devices. Some 
examples include:

* Patron Authentication (computer access, subscription databases) 
* Automated Material Handling (AMH) 
** The automated sorting of items, often to bins or book carts, based on shelving location or other programmable 
criteria

== Installing the SIP Server ==



This is a rough intro to installing the +SIP+ server for Evergreen. 

=== Getting the code ===

Current +SIP+ server code lives at in the Evergreen git repository:

   cd /opt 
   git clone git://git.evergreen-ils.org/SIPServer.git SIPServer 


=== Configuring the Server ===

indexterm:[configuration files, oils_sip.xml]

. Type the following commands from the command prompt: 

   $ sudo su opensrf 
   $ cd /openils/conf 
   $ cp oils_sip.xml.example oils_sip.xml 

. Edit oils_sip.xml. Change the commented out <server-params> section to this: 

   <server-params
      min_spare_servers='1' 
      max_spare_servers='2' 
      min_servers='3'
      max_servers='25' 
		/>

. max_servers will directly correspond to the number of allowed +SIP+ clients. Set the number accordingly, but 
bear in mind that too many connections can exhaust memory. On a 4G RAM/4 CPU server (that is also running 
evergreen), it is not recommended to exceed 100 +SIP+ client connections. 

==== Setting the encoding ====

SIPServer looks for the encoding in the following
places:

1. An +encoding+ attribute on the +account+ element for the currently active SIP account.
2. The +encoding+ element that is a child of the +institution+ element of the currently active SIP account.
3. The +encoding+ element that is a child of the +implementation_config+ element that is itself a child of the +institution+ element of the currently active SIP account.
4. If none of the above exist, then the default encoding (ASCII) is used.

Option 3 is a legacy option.  It is recommended that you alter your configuration to
move this element out of the +implementation_config+ element and into
its parent +institution+ element.  Ideally, SIPServer should *not* look into
the implementation config, and this check may be removed at some time
in the future.

==== Datatypes ====

The `msg64_hold_datatype` setting is similar to `msg64_summary_datatype`, but affects holds instead of circulations.
When set to `barcode`, holds information will be delivered as a set of copy barcodes instead of title strings for
patron info requests. With barcodes, SIP clients can both find the title strings for display (via item info requests)
and make subsequent hold-related action requests, like holds cancellation. 


=== Adding SIP Users ===

indexterm:[configuration files, oils_sip.xml]

. Type the following commands from the command prompt: 

  $ sudo su opensrf 
  $ cd /openils/conf

. In the +<accounts>+ section, add +SIP+ client login information. Make sure that all +<logins>+ use the same 
institution attribute, and make sure the institution is listed in +<institutions>+. All attributes in the 
+<login>+ section will be used by the +SIP+ client. 

. In Evergreen, create a new profile group called +SIP+. This group should be a sub-group of +Users+ (not +Staff+ 
or +Patrons+). Set _Editing Permission_ as *group_application.user.sip_client* and give the group the following 
permissions: 
+
     COPY_CHECKIN 
     COPY_CHECKOUT 
     CREATE_PAYMENT
     RENEW_CIRC 
     VIEW_CIRCULATIONS 
     VIEW_COPY_CHECKOUT_HISTORY 
     VIEW_PERMIT_CHECKOUT 
     VIEW_USER 
     VIEW_USER_FINES_SUMMARY 
     VIEW_USER_TRANSACTIONS 
+
OR use SQL like: 
+
   
   INSERT INTO permission.grp_tree (name,parent,description,application_perm) 
   VALUES ('SIP', 1, 'SIP2 Client Systems', 'group_application.user.sip_client'); 
  
   INSERT INTO 
     permission.grp_perm_map (grp, perm, depth, grantable) 
   SELECT 
     g.id, p.id, 0, FALSE 
   FROM 
     permission.grp_tree g, 
     permission.perm_list p 
   WHERE 
     g.name = 'SIP' AND 
     p.code IN ( 
       'COPY_CHECKIN', 
       'COPY_CHECKOUT', 
       'RENEW_CIRC', 
       'VIEW_CIRCULATIONS', 
       'VIEW_COPY_CHECKOUT_HISTORY', 
       'VIEW_PERMIT_CHECKOUT', 
       'VIEW_USER', 
       'VIEW_USER_FINES_SUMMARY', 
       'VIEW_USER_TRANSACTIONS' 
    ); 
+
Verify:
+
    
    SELECT * 
    FROM permission.grp_perm_map pgpm 
        INNER JOIN permission.perm_list ppl ON pgpm.perm = ppl.id 
        INNER JOIN permission.grp_tree pgt ON pgt.id = pgpm.grp 
    WHERE pgt.name = 'SIP';
    
 
    
. For each account created in the +<login>+ section of oils_sip.xml, create a user (via the staff client user 
editor) that has the same username and password and put that user into the +SIP+ group. 

[NOTE]
===================
The expiration date will affect the +SIP+ users' connection so you might want to make a note of this 
somewhere. 
===================

=== Running the server ===

To start the +SIP+ server type the following commands from the command prompt: 


   $ sudo su opensrf 

   $ oils_ctl.sh -a [start|stop|restart]_sip 

indexterm:[SIP]


=== Logging-SIP ===

==== Syslog ====

indexterm:[syslog]


It is useful to log +SIP+ requests to a separate file especially during initial setup by modifying your syslog config file. 

. Edit syslog.conf. 

   $ sudo vi /etc/syslog.conf  # maybe /etc/rsyslog.conf


. Add this: 

   local6.*                -/var/log/SIP_evergreen.log 
 
. Syslog expects the logfile to exist so create the file. 

   $ sudo touch /var/log/SIP_evergreen.log 

. Restart sysklogd. 

   $ sudo /etc/init.d/sysklogd restart 


==== Syslog-NG ====

indexterm:[syslog-NG]

. Edit logging config. 

   sudo vi /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf 

. Add: 

   # +SIP2+ for Evergreen 
   filter    f_eg_sip { level(warn, err, crit) and facility(local6); }; 
   destination eg_sip { file("var/log/SIP_evergreen.log"); }; 
   log { source(s_all); filter(f_eg_sip); destination(eg_sip); }; 

. Syslog-ng expects the logfile to exist so create the file. 

   $ sudo touch /var/log/SIP_evergreen.log

. Restart syslog-ng 

   $ sudo /etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart 


indexterm:[SIP]


=== Testing Your SIP Connection ===

* In the root directory of the SIPServer code: 

   $ cd SIPServer/t 

* Edit SIPtest.pm, change the $instid, $server, $username, and $password variables. This will be 
enough to test connectivity. To run all tests, you'll need to change all the variables in the _Configuration_ section. 

   $ PERL5LIB=../ perl 00sc_status.t 
+
This should produce something like:
+

   1..4 
   ok 1 - Invalid username 
   ok 2 - Invalid username 
   ok 3 - login 
   ok 4 - SC status 

* Don't be dismayed at *Invalid Username*. That's just one of the many tests that are run. 

=== More Testing ===

Once you have opened up either the +SIP+ OR +SIP2+ ports to be accessible from outside you can do some testing 
via +telnet+. In the following tests:

* Replace +$server+ with your server hostname (or +localhost+ if you want to
  skip testing external access for now);
* Replace +$username+, +$password+, and +$instid+ with the corresponding values
  in the +<accounts>+ section of your SIP configuration file;
* Replace the +$user_barcode+ and +$user_password+ variables with the values
  for a valid user.
* Replace the +$item_barcode+ variable with the values for a valid item.

///////////////
Comments because we don't want to indent these numbered bullets!
///////////////

. Start by testing your ability to log into the SIP server:
+
[NOTE]
======================
We are using 6001 here which is associated with +SIP2+ as per our configuration. 
======================
+
   $ telnet $server 6001 
   Connected to $server. 
   Escape character is '^]'. 
   9300CN$username|CO$password|CP$instid
+
If successful, the SIP server returns a +941+ result. A result of +940+,
however, indicates an unsuccessful login attempt. Check the +<accounts>+
section of your SIP configuration and try again.

. Once you have logged in successfully, replace the variables in the following
line and paste it into the telnet session:
+
    2300120080623    172148AO$instid|AA$user_barcode|AC$password|AD$user_password
+
If successful, the SIP server returns the patron information for $user_barcode,
similar to the following:
+
   24  Y           00120100113    170738AEFirstName MiddleName LastName|AA$user_barcode|BLY|CQY
   |BHUSD|BV0.00|AFOK|AO$instid| 
+
The response declares it is a valid patron BLY with a valid password CQY and shows the user's +$name+.

. To test the SIP server's item information response, issue the following request:
+
    1700120080623    172148AO$instid|AB$item_barcode|AC$password
+
If successful, the SIP server returns the item information for $item_barcode,
similar to the following:
+
    1803020120160923    190132AB30007003601852|AJRÃ©gion de Kamouraska|CK001|AQOSUL|APOSUL|BHCAD
    |BV0.00|BGOSUL|CSCA2 PQ NR46 73R
+
The response declares it is a valid item, with the title, owning library,
permanent and current locations, and call number.

== SIP Communication ==

For full protocol details and all message types, see:
xref:sip_server_communication.adoc[SIP Communication and Message Types Reference].

== Patron privacy and the SIP protocol ==

SIP traffic includes a lot of patron information, and is not
encrypted by default.  It is strongly recommended that you
encrypt any SIP traffic.

=== SIP server configuration ===

On the SIP server, use `iptables` or `etc/hosts` to allow SSH connections on port 22 from the SIP client machine.  You will probably want to have very restrictive rules
on which IP addresses can connect to this server.


=== SSH tunnels on SIP clients ===

SSH tunnels are a good fit for use cases like self-check machines, because it is relatively easy to automatically open the connection.  Using a VPN is another option,
but many VPN clients require manual steps to open the VPN connection.

. If the SIP client will be on a Windows machine, install cygwin on the SIP client.
. On the SIP client, use `ssh-keygen` to generate an SSH key.
. Add the public key to /home/my_sip_user/.ssh/authorized_keys on your SIP server to enable logins without using the UNIX password.
. Configure an SSH tunnel to open before every connection.  You can do this in several ways:
.. If the SIP client software allows you to run an arbitrary command before
   each SIP connection, use something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh -f -L 6001:localhost:6001 my_sip_user@my_sip_server.com sleep 10
----
+
.. If you feel confident that the connection won't get interrupted, you can have something like this run at startup:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh -f -N -L 6001:localhost:6001 my_sip_user@my_sip_server.com
----
+
.. If you want to constantly poll to make sure that the connection is still running, you can do something like this as a cron job or scheduled task on the SIP client machine:
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
instances=`/bin/ps -ef | /bin/grep ssh | /bin/grep -v grep | /bin/wc -l`
if [ $instances -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Restarting ssh tunnel"
  /usr/bin/ssh -L 6001:localhost:6001 my_sip_user@my_sip_server.com -f -N
fi
----
