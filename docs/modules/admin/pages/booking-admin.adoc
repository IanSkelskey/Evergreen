== Creating Bookable Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

[NOTE]
====
A staff account with circulator permissions or higher is required to create bookable non-bibliographic resources, such as laptops, projectors, and meeting rooms.
====

Before creating resources (bookable items), you must first define resource types and their attributes. Each resource type can have multiple attributes, and each attribute can have multiple values. Once you have defined the resource types and attributes, you can create individual resources and link them to their attributes and values using the Resource Attribute Map.

== Editing Non-Bibliographic Resources ==

Staff with the required permissions can edit aspects of existing non-bibliographic resources. For example, resource type can be edited in the event that the fine amount for a laptop changes from $2.00 to $5.00.

=== Editing Resource Types ===

. Bring up your list of resource types. Select Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resource Types.

. A list of current resource types will appear.

. Double click anywhere on the line of the resource type you would like to edit.

. The resource type box will appear. Make your changes and click Save.

. Following the same procedure you may edit Resource Attributes, Attributes Values, Resources and Attribute Map by selecting them on Administration -> Booking Administration.




== Deleting Non-bibliographic Resources ==

. To delete a booking resource, go to Administration -> Booking Administration -> Resources.

. Select the checkbox in front the resource you want to delete. Click Delete Selected. The resource will disappear from the list.

Following the same procedure you may delete Resource Attributes Maps.

You may also delete Resource Attribute Values, Resource Attributes and Resource Types. But you have to delete them in the reverse order when you create them to make sure the entry is not in use when you try to delete it.

This is the deletion order: Resource Attribute Map/Resources -> Resource Attribute Values -> Resource Attributes -> Resource Types.
