Bibliographic record notes can be edited from the
Record Notes tab in a staff catalog bibliographic
record view.  There are three permissions
that allow users to work with record notes:

* `CREATE_RECORD_NOTE`
* `UPDATE_RECORD_NOTE`
* `DELETE_RECORD_NOTE`

If there are notes on a record, the Record Notes
tab will show a count of the record's notes.
