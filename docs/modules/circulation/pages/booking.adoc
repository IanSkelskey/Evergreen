== Additional Resources ==

The Booking module is managed through the Booking Administration module.
 See <<docs-modules-admin-pages-booking-admin.adoc,Booking Administration>>
for more details.

== Overview ==

The Booking module allows libraries to manage reservations for bookable resources, such as study rooms, equipment, and other items. This module is useful for libraries that offer resources that can be reserved in advance. The booking module can be accessed from the top menu bar in the staff client.

indexterm:[booking,reserving a resource] indexterm:[booking,creating a
reservation] indexterm:[reserving a bookable resource]

[NOTE]
The "Create a booking reservation" screen uses your library's timezone.
If you create a reservation at a library in a different timezone, Evergreen
will alert you and provide the time in both your timezone and the other
library's timezone.

Reservations can only be created by staff members and can be initiated from
a patron record, a booking resource, or the catalog if the booking item's
barcode is not known.
